Bio:

Name: Fernando Martinez

I'm an avid fighting game player, I was ranked top 100 in the world in Street Fighter X Tekken and have been playing since I was in middle school. I am a software engineer and a fellow at the Marcy Lab School, hopefully I can find a job within a year so I can start building my career.
